# Monti Hall Simulation

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle based on the American TV game show "Let's Make a Deal." In this puzzle, the player faces three closed doors: behind one is a car, and behind the other two are goats. The game begins with the player choosing a door. The host then reveals a goat behind one of the two remaining doors, and the player is given the option to switch doors. This simulation explores whether switching doors increases the player's chances of winning the car.
